<h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>4 servings
    <li>3 1/2 cups flour</li>
    
    <li>5 g yeast (half a packet)</li>
    
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    
    <li>1 1/2 tbs sugar</li>
    
    <li>1-2 litre oil</li>
    
<p>    <li>Warm water</li></ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Method</h4>
    <br>
    <ul>Step 1</ul>
    Cover the dough balls and allow them to rise again in a warm spot (10+ minutes). This second rise gives a nice texture
    <br>
    <ul>Step 2</ul>
    Mix lukewarm water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to bubble slightly, about 5 minutes
    <br>
    <ul>Step 3</ul>
    Sift flour and salt together in a large bowl.
    <br>
    <ul>Step 4</ul>
    Pour water mixture over flour mixture and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover bowl with clean cloth and let dough rise until until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.
    <br>
    <ul>Step 5</ul>
    Roll dough until smooth and at least 1 inch thick. Use a size 3 inch biscuit cutter to cut in equal sizes. Repeat with remaining dough.
    <br>
    <ul>Step 6</ul>
    Drain well and then place on paper towels to absorb the oil.
    <br>
    <ul>Step 7</ul>
    Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 175Â°C. Fry the dough balls in the hot oil, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. You can see when the bottom half is brown and that's when you turn them over.
    <br>
    <ul>Step 8</ul>
    Serve stuffed with curried or savoury mince, butter and jam or syrup. Whatever you want really, and any type of curry is fine.
